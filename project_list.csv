COVID-19 Modelling Activities,NA,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,2023-06-01T00:00:00Z,"SPARK collaborators produced various high-level and governmental reports, publications and articles in relation to COVID-19 preparedness and situational analysis work in 2020. SPARK provided scenario modelling and situational awareness support in Malaysia and the Philippines in relation to COVID-19 and tuberculosis.",spark
SAFETY-NET Training,"patricia-campbell,michael-meehan,eamon-conway,nefel-tellioglu",2020-11-01T00:00:00Z,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,"To increase regional capacity, SPECTRUM and SPARK collaborators hosted a workshop entitled ‘Understanding Infectious Disease Modelling’ to a select group of participants for the Taiwan Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), in partnership with the South Asia Field Epidemiology and Technology Network (SAFETYNET) at their regional conference in November 2020, and at the Australasian COVID-19 Virtual Conference (PHAA) in December 2020. This workshop had a focus on modelling for COVID-19, highlighting the significance of epidemiological modelling in the development of public health interventions, situational analyses and emergency response. Targeted at policy advisors and public health officials, this workshop aimed to assist policy and decision makers make better expert use of evidence in adaptive control programs.",spark
WHO Seminar Series,jodie-mcvernon,2020-09-01T00:00:00Z,2020-09-01T00:00:00Z,"SPARK worked in close collaboration with Linh-Vi Le (Lead, Strategic Epidemiology and Modelling, COVID-19, WPRO, member of SPARK’s expert reference group) in appropriate uses of modelling and translation of modelling outputs to policy. SPARK contributed over June/July to a webinar series for WHO regional and country staff across the Asia-Pacific, covering topics of preparedness modelling for policy, non-pharmaceutical interventions and health economics. A subsequent series delivered in September 2020 considered outbreak response, mobility assessment and impacts, optimal use of testing and the use of excess mortality data as an indicator of epidemic activity.",spark
Mahidol University Scholarships,wirichada-pan-ngum,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,2023-06-01T00:00:00Z,Key training partner Mahidol University in Thailand recruited six students from the Asia Pacific region to undertake the university’s Masters in Biomedical Health and Informatics. These scholarships were funded through SPARK.,spark
The use of mobility data to model the transmission of COVID-19 in Indonesia,"kamran-najeebullah,raja-jurdak,cameron-zachreson,iadine-chades,dean-paini,iqbal-elyazar,ihsan-fadilah,henry-surendra,karina-lestari,rahmat-sagara",2020-06-01T00:00:00Z,2023-06-01T00:00:00Z,"SPARK collaborators engage with research staff at EOCRU in Indonesia, where they have adapted and developed models to better understand transmission pathways and mobility of COVID-19 in Indonesia. A small technical team of SPARK researchers, supported by DiNeMo at CSIRO and WEHI, have supported the team at EOCRU to collect and clean COVID-19 case and mobility data, adapt models to accurately model transmission of disease and analyse the data received. As well as high-level technical support and guidance provided by SPARK, two Indonesian researchers within this team were awarded scholarships to undertake Masters degrees in Biomedical Health and Informatics scholarships to support this work.",spark
