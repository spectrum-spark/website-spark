This year’s Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting (JITMM) will be held on 13-15 December 2023 at Eastin Grand Hotel Phayathai, Bangkok, Thailand.
 
JTIMM 2023 is hosted on a hybrid setting by the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. Participants are able to attend JITMM 2023 onsite and virtually for those unable to travel internationally. This inclusive platform provides for participants to network, update and exchange knowledge, and develop collaborations with participants with similar research interests.
 
This year's theme is “Achieving the SDGs: Human and AI-driven Solutions for Tropical Medicine in a Changing World”. JITMM 2023 will highlight the role and impact of innovative technologies on advances in tropical medicine and sustainable development amidst critical global challenges.
