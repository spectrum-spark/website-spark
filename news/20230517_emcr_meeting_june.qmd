On May 15, the SPECTRUM & SPARK EMCR Network will meet for the first training session of the year, on likelihoods, maximum likelihood estimation and a bit more. Anyone who identifies themselves as an EMCR in the network is welcome to attend. If you are not on the list and want to be, please email <spectrum-spark@unimelb.edu.au>.

## The session

This month, Dr Eamon Conway will lead the network through a practical application of Maximum Likelihood Estimation, including when it's useful, when it's not, and how to implement it for some infectious diseases models.

More skills is more good, so please come along to see how it's done from an expert, and ask questions to improve your understanding.

## Feedback

We'd love to hear what _you_ want out of these sessions. If you have any ideas, or would like to sign up for a WIP talk, or to run a training session, please let the EMCR Chair (Michael Lydeamore) know by emailing in <spectrum-spark@unimelb.edu.au>.
