In March 2023, members from the SPARK training team travelled to Bali, Indonesia, to run another week long short course in infectious diseases modelling. Participants at these courses range include public health professionals, decision makers, and academic researchers, all of whom are exposed, use, or create infectious diseases models.

The attending team was: 

* [Dr Patricia Campbell](staff/patricia-campbell), 
* [A/Prof. Roslyn Hickson](https://research.jcu.edu.au/portfolio/roslyn.hickson/)
* [Dr Eamon Conway](staff/eamon-conway)
* [Dr Michael Lydeamore](staff/michael-lydeamore)
* [Laura Bannerman](staff/laura-bannerman)

## The program

The short course is a high intensity week, with introductions to dynamic disease models, model fitting processes, how to think about interventions, and how to build your own model from scratch using a whiteboard!

The course was very well attended, with approximately 40 invited attendees, all of whom were highly engaged with the material and made teaching the course a breeze.

Here is a snap of Dr Campbell explaining how a likelihood function works:

Of course, with such a busy week, it's important to give our brains some time to relax. The Patra Bali, where most participants were staying, helped set up an excellent banquet dinner on Thursday night, which included some great music, and dancing from all. Who would've known Hendry Surendra was such an amazing singer, and Eamon Conway was such an amazing dancer:

## What comes next

If you attended the course, we'd love to hear from you about what you thought. Good things, bad things, what could be improved, all of it. Please email any thoughts to <spectrum-spark@unimelb.edu.au>. What's more, if you are _using_ some of this in your every day worok, well we'd love to hear that too.

SPARK is once again delivering this course in Yogyakarta soon, so keep your eyes peeled for a wrap-up from Indonesia. I'm sure the week will be great fun once again.
