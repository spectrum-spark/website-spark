    "text": "From 29th May-2nd June 2023, 33 participants from Vietnam’s lead universities, research institutions and government, specializing in One Health joined a ‘Health Security Leadership’ Training of Trainer workshop in Da Nang, Viet Nam. The purpose of the workshop was not only to develop a foundational course on health security that could be rolled out in the country, but also to create a One Health training team for Viet Nam, using the Vietnam One Health University Network (VOHUN) as a vehicle.\nOne Health experts from the Nossal Institute for Global Health developed the training, with input from SPARK partner, Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City and from VOHUN leaders. Associate Professor Dr Nguyen Vu Trung, Director of the Pasteur Institute, Ho Chi Minh City gave an opening address for the workshop, emphasizing the importance of health security in the country. The sessions were facilitated by Max Barot, Anna Barrett and Sonja Firth from the Nossal Institute for Global Health, aided by Dr Pham Duc Phuc (VOHUN) and Dr Pham Duy Quang (Pasteur Institute, HCMC). Dr Do Hong Hien Thi from Viet Nam’s WHO Emergency response gave an invited lecture on ‘Health security in a national context’.\n\nThe workshop covered specific health security concerns, such as human and animal health system preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment and outbreak response as well as cross-cutting themes of public health communication and community engagement for health security. The environment as an ecosystem connecting and reacting to changes in the animal and human health system – and the impact of this on health security – was also explored. The focus on a One Health approach emphasised joint working and collaborations, which was also evident in the range of participants, with backgrounds in human health, animal health and the environment. The workshop prioritised interactive elements and social learning, with exercises designed to explore relationships and experiences across the different disciplines.\n\n\nAnd it was not all work, as a welcome function and final workshop dinner, complete with karaoke, provided more relaxed opportunities for networking and relationship building. The backdrop of Da Nang beachfront was conducive to these festivities!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA planning session at the end of the workshop drew a roadmap for the adaptation of the course and translation into Vietnamese. We look forward to seeing the course in its new format in the future in Vietnam! The workshop ended with a song, as befitting the Vietnam locale.\nThanks to Laura Bannerman, SPARK Program Coordinator and to the local organizing team from Pasteur Institute HCMC, Mr Le Duy Hoang Chuong, Ms Trần Thanh Dung and Ms Phạm Thị Thanh Ngân for all their hard work to make this workshop happen!"

The One Health Economics course addressed a key gap in knowledge in the region, identified at a recent meeting of the Southeast Asia One Health University Network (SEAOHUN), with which THOHUN is affiliated. The course was delivered by Dr Justin McKinley and Dr Max Barot from Nossal Institute for Global Health, together with the team from Mahidol University led by Dr. Arthorn Riewpaiboon. Participants learnt economic principles as well as how these apply to One Health, including One Health Economic Evaluation methods - Cost-Benefit Analysis, Cost-Utility Analysis, social returns on investment, amongst others. They also had the opportunity to analyse and apply economic principles and tools to address local One Health issues.\n\nAlthough a new topic to most, the participants found the content and delivery accessible and engaging and after the course, a large majority could see how to apply Health Economics principles in their work. From the same evaluation, all were glad they attended the course and would recommend it to others. More interactive sessions and scenarios and a greater emphasis on environmental health were suggested for future trainings.\n\nThis course will in future be available on-line for others to benefit from the approach. We look forward to future collaborations amongst the group to forward this important component in One Health curriculum development. Many thanks to Assoc. Prof. Saengduen Moonsom and her team at THOHUN for coordinating and organizing this event. For more information on THOHUN and their activities visit https://thohun.org/"

We will be alternating between two formats:\n\nA career skills and/or networking session and WIP talk from a network member\nA training session\n\nThis month, we’ll start with some icebreakers so we can all remember who we all are, and welcome anyone new into the network. Then, Isobell Abell will give a WIP presentation on some of her recent work."

Uncertainty and the management of epidemics. Nature Methods, 17(9), pp.867-868. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-0943-4\n\n\nThis set of free articles on Nature Methods goes through some basic infectious disease models, how to interpret them and how to account for uncertainty in models. Each article is two pages long, making them convenient for quickly learning how to interpret and understand infectious disease models.\n\nVynnycky, E. and White, R., 2010. An Introduction to Infectious Disease Modelling. Oxford University Press.\n\nThis is an excellent textbook on how mathematical equations can be used to build infectious disease models. Unlike other textbooks on infectious disease models, you do not need a strong mathematics background to understand the contents of the book. This is a great textbook to read for a comprehensive understanding of different parts of infectious disease models.\n\nJohnson, L., 2016. Agent-Based Model Basics: A Guidebook & Checklist for Policy Researchers. Westphalia Press.\n\nAlthough not specific to infectious diseases, this short book outlines what agent-based models (models involving computer simulations) are and how they are used in policymaking. This is a great book for those who are interested in learning more about this emerging area of infectious disease modelling.\n\nCampbell, P., Geard, N., Glass, K., McBryde, E., McCaw, J., McVernon, J., Moss, R., Ross, J., and Wood, J., 2016. A User’s Guide to Infectious Disease Modelling. University of Melbourne. http://prism.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/PRISM_Modelling-guidelines-web.pdf\n\nThis guide is intended for policymakers and public health practitioners who want to learn how to interpret the results of infectious disease modelling studies. It not only goes through the basics of infectious disease models and economic evaluation, but it also gives a set of guidelines for assessing whether an infectious disease model answers your policy questions.\n\nKucharski, A., 2020. The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread - and Why They Stop. Profile Books Ltd. \n\nThis is a comprehensive general interest book that explains how mathematical models can be applied not only to infectious diseases, but also financial panics, memes and much more. Although the book is long, the book does not use much mathematics to explain how mathematical models work and how they can be applied in real-life. This book is great for those that want to know how mathematical models are used in other areas of public policy, not just public health."
